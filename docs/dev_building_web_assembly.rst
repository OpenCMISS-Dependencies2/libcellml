Building libCellML for use in the Browser
=========================================

To build libCellML for the browser we use the emscripten toolchain to create web assembly binaries.
Here we will go through the process of building web assembly binaries on macOS.
For other operating systems modifications to these instructions will have to be made.
Any modifications required are expected to be self evident â€“ with this in mind these instructions should be universally applicable.

Preparation
===========

To build libCellML for the browser we will need the following tools ready for use.

- Emscripten
- Compiler toolchain
- CMake
- Git

Building
========

libCellML requires two dependencies to be built before libCellML itself can be built.
We will clone and build those first and then move on to building libCellML.

Dependencies
------------

Start by creating a directory under which all our files will live and make it our current directory for subsequent commands::

  mkdir emscripten
  cd emscripten

Now we can clone our dependencies (we suggest using these exact repositories other repositories may work but these repositories are known to work)::

  git clone https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Dependencies/zlib.git -b develop
  git clone https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Dependencies/libxml2.git -b v2.9.6

We will create two directories to hold the build files::

  mkdir build-zlib-release
  mkdir build-libxml2-release

Then we will configure, build, and install zlib as this is required by libxml2.
We will install zlib under our emscripten working directory and **not** into the system directories::

  cd build-zlib-release
  emcmake cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../usr/local ../zlib/

Here we have changed our working directory into the directory marked for our zlib build files.
We have also comfigured the project using the emscripten wrapper script `emcmake`.
This script sets up environment variables for us to make building with the emscripten compilers easy.
We also configure the zlib library to be built in `Release` mode and set the install prefix relative to the **source** directory and not the **build** directory.
However this is not an issue for us as the **source** and **build** directories are sibling directories.

To build and install the zlib library we simply issue these commands::

  make
  make install

Next we follow a similar procedure for building `libxml2`.
Start by making the libxml2 build directory the current directory::

  cd ../build-libxml2-release

Then as before configure the library::

  emcmake cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../usr/local -DZLIB_DIR=../usr/local/share/cmake/ZLIB/ -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=../usr/local -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF ../libxml2/

There are two additions to the configure command this time;

1. We set ZLIB_DIR to enable the configuration to find our zlib library we just installed, and
2. We turn off building a shared libxml2 library.

As a general note it is better to specify the variable `ZLIB_DIR` as an absolute path and not a relative path as we have done here.
Feel free to use the absolute path when you are configuring libXml2.

Then as before we simply issue the build and install commands::

  make
  make install

That is all that is required for preparing the dependencies ready for libCellML.

libCellML
---------

Following a similar approach to building the dependencies we can now configure and build libCellML.
We don't install libCellML the web assembly binary does not get installed we have to get it from the build directory.

To get started we will make our current directory the `emscripten` directory we made at the start of these instructions.
Assuming we are in the directory where we left off from preparing the dependencies we simply change to the parent directory::

  cd ..

If you current directory is not where the dependency instructions left off then modify the command as appropriate for your situation.

Okay, so let's get the source code using `git clone`::

  git clone https://github.com/hsorby/libcellml.git -b emscripten

The first thing you will note is that this code is not from the official libCellML repository.
This work is still in a development stage and hasn't been properly vetted yet for general consumption.
It is quite likely that you will encounter problems, and if you do don't be afraid to get in touch by creating an issue or whichever way you feel comfortable with.

Now we will create a build directory and make it the current directory::

  mkdir build-libcellml-release
  cd build-libcellml-release

We can now configure the library::

  emcmake cmake -DLibXml2_DIR=../usr/local/share/cmake/LibXml2/ -DBUILD_TYPE=Release ../libcellml/

As with the earlier note it is best if `LibXml2_DIR` is an absolute path and not a relative path as shown here.

The last thing we have to do is build the library::

  make

That should be everything done.

Outcome
=======

If these instructions have been accurate then we should see two files `libcellml.js` and `libcellml.wasm` in the `src/bindings/javascript/` relative from the libCellML build directory where we left off above.
