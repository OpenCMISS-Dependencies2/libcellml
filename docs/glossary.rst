   Prime repository
   Prime libCellML repository
      The repository at https://github.com/cellml/libcellml is the definitive repository for the software and used for creating software releases.
      We will refer to this repository as the **prime** repository.

   Python
      Python is a scripting language for which bindings to libCellML can be generated.  There are instructions for installing Python in :ref:`_devSetup_python`.
   
   
   Toolchain
      The term "toolchain" is used to the set of different software products needed in order to change code into an application.  This can include a text editor, a compiler, a linker, a debugger, and more.  Toolchains are frequently hidden inside Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), which collect all the tools into one place and provide a single user interface for them together.
   
   C++
      The language in which libCellML is written.  
   
   SWIG
      `SWIG <http://www.swig.org/>`_ (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) is a tool which acts as a translator between code written in C++ and other languages.  LibCellML uses SWIG to generate the (optional) Python bindings - if you are not intending to use libCellML in other languages then you will not need to install SWIG.  Instructions for installing and using SWIG on the various operating systems are given on the `Setup<>`_ page.
   
   Doxygen
      `Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.nl/>`_ is software which assembles documentation files directly from annotated source code, including the generation of inheritance and dependency tree diagrams for classes. More information on installing Doxygen is given in :ref:`devSetup_doxygen`.
